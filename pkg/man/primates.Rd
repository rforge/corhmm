\title{Example datasets}
\description{
Example files for running various functions in \code{corHMM}. The \dQuote{primates} dataset comes from the example files provided by BayesTraits, though here we only include a single tree with branch lengths scaled to time. The \dQuote{primates.paint} dataset is the same, but with the tree painted according to hypothetical regimes. Finally, the \dQuote{rayDISC.example} dataset provides an example on how polymorphic data can be coded for \code{rayDISC}.
